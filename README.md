# Old Java project

By: HenaNIeminen


## Introduction
This is my Contact management app programmed in java. It can store various information from a given subject. Including:

-ID (Finnish SSN)

-Given name

-Surname

-Phone number (Finnish country code only accepted)

-Physical address (Optional, can be left as empty)

-Email address    (Optional)


The user interface is comprised solely of CLI and is navigated using prompts and numerical keys. You can view, add, delete
edit saved contacts. When a contact is added, it will generate a file into the source folder of the compiled program.

## What is this?

An old school project that I decided to archive on my profile.
